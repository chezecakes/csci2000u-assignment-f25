    "## Introduction\n",
    "A \"sport\" has traditionally been defined as any competitive-based activity involving physical, full-body movement. However, since the invention of the computer and later, video games, the term has slowly been 'widening' to accommodate other forms of competitive play. Gradually, as more competitive-style video games released (such as shooters, battle arenas, etc. - more information on genres is discussed below), more people around the world started to realize their skills in these games and like-minded players begun hosting tournaments together. Communities formed, tournaments got bigger, groups and organizations dedicated to these tournaments were founded; this all accumulated to the eSports industry that it is today.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Despite the rapid growth it has seen since the beginning, the eSports industry is still relatively very young, where there still does not exist proper standardized regulations, administration, or a sole governing body. National governments also have varied involvement in supervising eSports tournaments and the like; in general, it is very inconsistent. This has caused concerns over the integrity of the industry and its future, with people questioning the credibility of finding a career or investing in eSports, and even whether or not any part of the eSports market is profitable. Numerous forms of research/media have analyzed the industry and discussed what eSports needs to be sustainable, and in this report, the question that is looking to be answered is: **\"how does the genre of video game correlate to its success (or lack thereof) in eSports?\"**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Video game genre is fundamental to the eSport treatment a game may receive in its lifetime. Recall that sports are by definition competitive—this requires the video game as well to at least include some sort of competitive aspect, in which players can compete for things like a higher score, faster elapsed time, more wins, etc. The genre of video game defines what kind of gameplay style is to be expected, and thus tells us whether or not the game is naturally competitive.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Common, non-competitive video game genres include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adventure\n",
    "- Interactive/Visual Novel\n",
    "- Simulators\n",
    "- Sandbox\n",
    "- Open-world Exploration\n",
    "- Horror/Survival\n",
    "- Platformer\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not an exhaustive list and each general genre contains its own specific sub-genres, however, it is not relevant to this report. Instead, we are concerned with the competitively-driven genres of video games. Based on the dataset used, the following list shows all of the video game genres that have seen activity in eSports:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strategy\n",
    "- First-Person Shooter (FPS)\n",
    "- Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA)\n",
    "- Role-Playing Game (RPG)\n",
    "- Fighting Game\n",
    "- Racing\n",
    "- Sports\n",
    "- Collectible Card Game (sometimes referred to as \"Trading Card Game\" or \"TCG\")\n",
    "- Puzzle Game\n",
    "- Battle Royale\n",
    "- Third-Person Shooter\n",
    "- Music/Rhythm Game\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is taken from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rankirsh/esports-earnings/data), and is authored by Ran Kirshenboim, who mentions that the dataset sources from [EsportEarnings.com](https://www.esportsearnings.com/). Along with the video game name, it contains each game's release year, genre, total earnings (including offline and % of earnings offline), total players, and total number of tournaments (all within 1998 to 2023)."
