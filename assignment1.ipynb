    "A \"sport\" has traditionally been defined as any competitive-based activity involving physical, full-body movement. However, since the invention of the computer and later, video games, the term has slowly been 'widening' to accomodate other forms of competitive play. Gradually, as more competitive-style video games released (such as shooters, battle arenas, etc. - more information on genres is discussed below), more people around the world started to realize their skills in these games and like-minded players begun hosting tournaments together.
